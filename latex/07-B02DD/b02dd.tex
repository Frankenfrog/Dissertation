\label{sec:b02dd}

In this chapter the analysis of \BdToDD decays with the goal to determine the
observables \SDD and \CDD, which describe the \CP violation in this decay
mode, is presented~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2016-037}. After a description of the
selection (see \cref{sec:b02dd:selection}) the fit of the invariant mass
distribution, performed to extract signal sWeights, is described (see
\cref{sec:b02dd:massfit}). This is followed by a summary of the decay time fit
(see \cref{sec:b02dd:decaytimefit}). The chapter is concluded with a
presentation of the studies on systematic uncertainties (see
\cref{sec:b02dd:systematics}). The new OS combination including the OS charm
tagger and the SS combination of SS\pion and SS\proton tagger are used to
determine the flavour tag of the \Bd mesons. The calibration of these
flavour-tagging algorithms using \BdToDsD decays (see
\cref{sec:dataanalysis:taggingcalibration:dsdcalibration}) is the only part
not performed by myself but by collaborators from Milano.
