\section{Decay time fit}
\label{sec:b02dd:decaytimefit}

The conditional PDF describing the reconstructed decay time $t'$ and tag
decisions $\vect{d'} = (\dos, \dss)$, given a per-event decay time resolution
$\sigma_{t'}$ and per-event mistag probability estimates $\vect{\eta} = (\etaos,
\etass)$, is
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fullpdf}
  P\left(t',\vect{d'}\given \sigma_{t'},\vect{\eta}\right)
  \propto \epsilon(t') \left(\mathcal{P}(t,\vect{d'}\given \vect{\eta})
    \otimes \mathcal{R}(t'-t\given \sigma_{t'})\right)\,,
\end{equation}
%
where
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{P}(t,\vect{d'}\given \vect{\eta}) \\
  \propto \sum_{d} \mathcal{P}(\vect{d'} \given d,\vect{\eta})
      [1 - d\, A_\text{P}] \,
      e^{-t/\tau}\left\{1 - d\, S \sin(\dm t) + d\, C \cos(\dm t)\right\}\,,
\end{equation}
and where $t$ is the true decay time, $d$ is the true production flavour,
$A_\text{P}$ is the production asymmetry, and $\mathcal{P}(\vect{d'} \given
d,\vect{\eta})$ is a two-dimensional binomial PDF describing the distribution
of tagging decisions given $\vect{\eta}$ and $d$. Normalisation factors are omitted for brevity.

\subsection{External inputs}
\label{sec:b02dd:decaytimefit:constraints}

\lhcb has performed a measurement of the production asymmetry as a function
of transverse momentum and pseudorapidity using \SI{7}{\TeV}
data~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2014-042}. Taking those distributions from \BdToDD
individual weighted averages for the 2011 and 2012 subsamples are calculated
yielding
%
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \prodasym{11} &= -0.0047 \pm 0.0106 \,\text{(stat)} \pm 0.0014 \, \text{(syst)} \,, \\
    \prodasym{12} &= -0.0071 \pm 0.0107 \,\text{(stat)} \pm 0.0014 \, \text{(syst)} \,.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
%
As the measurement of the production asymmetry has been performed on 2011 data
only, the numbers for $\prodasym{11}$ and $\prodasym{12}$ are highly
correlated. So, the latter is modelled as $\prodasym{12} = \prodasym{11} +
\Delta\prodasym{}$ with $\Delta\prodasym{} = -0.0024 \pm 0.0018
\,\text{(syst)}$. The systematic uncertainty accounts for the difference of
the production asymmetries observed for the two data-taking conditions in the
measurement of the semileptonic $\CP$ asymmetry~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2014-053} and
is used as the width of a Gaussian constraint. The $\Bz$ oscillation frequency and
the $\Bz$ lifetime are constrained to $\dm =
\SI{0.510\pm0.003}{\planckbar\invps}$~\cite{PDG2014} and $\tau =
\SI{1.519\pm0.005}{\ps}$~\cite{PDG2014}, respectively. The
flavour-tagging calibration parameters
(\cref{tab:dataanalysis:taggingcalibration:dsdcalibration}) are constrained
within their combined statistical and systematic uncertainties, determined in
the calibration using \BdToDsD decays. The decay time resolution parameters
(\cref{tab:b02dd:decaytimefit:resolution}) and the $\Bz$ lifetime difference
$\DG = \SI{0}{\invps}$ are fixed in the likelihood fit.

\subsection{Results}

The fit results of the $\CP$ observables from the decay time fit are
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
  \SDD                &= -0.54\,\pm\,^{0.17}_{0.16} \, , \\
  \CDD                &= \phantom{-}0.26\,\pm\,0.17 \, , \\
  \rho(\SDD,\CDD)     &= \phantom{-}0.48 \, . \\
\end{split}
\label{eq:b02dd:decaytimefit:cpresults}
\end{align}

Only after rescaling the sWeights via
\begin{align}
  w_i = w_i \frac{\sum w_i}{\sum w_i^2}\,,
\end{align}
correct asymmetric uncertainty estimates are delivered by \minos, which is
\root's standard method to analyse the likelihood shape. To check if the
coverage is guaranteed the bootstrapping method is applied. The nominal fit
procedure, \ie performing the mass fit, calculating the sWeights and fitting
the weighted tagged decay time distribution, is executed and the fit results
are stored. The drawing and fitting is done \num{10000} times. It turns out
that half of the fits fail if the flavour-tagging calibration parameters are
constrained within their statistical uncertainties. When fixing them to their
central values the fit failure rate drops to a per-mille effect. From the
distribution of fit results the two-side \SI{68}{\percent} confidence
intervals are extracted. To account for the uncertainties on the
flavour-tagging calibration parameters \num{10000} pseudoexperiments are
performed, in which the nominal model is used to generate the signal decay
time distribution and the fit results of the nominal fit are chosen for the
\CP observables \SDD and \CDD. Before generating the flavour-tagging
calibration parameters are drawn from Gaussian distributions around their
central values using the combined statistical + systematic uncertainties. In
the subsequent fit the flavour-tagging calibration parameters are fixed to
their central values, like in the fits to the bootstrapped samples. The
resulting pull distributions are broader than standard normal distributions.
The deviation of the width from unity shows how much the statistical
uncertainties are underestimated in the likelihood fit due to not accounting
for the variation of the flavour-tagging calibration parameters. So, the
statistical uncertainties for \SDD and \CDD from the bootstrapping including
the impact of the uncertainty of the flavour-tagging calibration parameters
are given by scaling the bootstrapping uncertainties by the width of the pull
distributions:
\begin{align}
    \sigma_{\SDD}(\text{bootstrapping}) &= \,^{+0.17}_{-0.16} \,, \\
    \sigma_{\CDD}(\text{bootstrapping}) &= \,^{+0.18}_{-0.17} \,.
\end{align}
These uncertainties match the nominal ones from \minos quite well. A plot of
the decay time distribution and the projection of the acceptance model are
shown in \cref{fig:b02dd:decaytimefit}. Good agreement between the latter and
the shape on signal MC (cf. \cref{fig:b02dd:decaytimefit:acceptance_MC}) can
be observed but the low statistics leading to rather large uncertainties
indicated by the error band diminishes the significance of the comparison.

Apart from a quite high positive correlation between the parameters of the
acceptance spline function and the already quoted correlation of about
\num{0.5} between $\SDD$ and $\CDD$, which is expected from first principles
(see Ref.~\cite{LHCb-ANA-2011-004}), no large correlation between fitted parameters
is present as can be seen from the correlation matrix visualised in
\cref{fig:b02dd:decaytimefit:FullFitCorrMatrixHotCold}. A possible correlation
between $\dm$ and $\CDD$ is significantly reduced by the constraint applied on $\dm$,
which is a lot tighter than the sensitivity accessible from the data sample.
When releasing this constraint the correlation coefficient becomes \num{-0.8}.
But the sensitivity on $\CDD$ would significantly go down in this scenario so
the constraint on $\dm$ is maintained in the nominal setup.

In \cref{fig:b02dd:decaytimefit:asymmetry} the signal yield asymmetry is
plotted in eight bins of the decay time. A binned $\chisq$-fit to this signal
asymmetry is performed using
\begin{align}
{\mathcal A}^{\text{meas}}(t) = \frac{\Delta\omega + \prodasym{11}(1 - \Delta\omega) + (1 - \Delta\omega + \prodasym{11}\Delta\omega){\mathcal A}^{\text{theo}}(t)}{1 + \prodasym{11}(\SDD \sin(\dm\,t) - \CDD \cos(\dm\,t))}\,,
\label{eq:b02dd:decaytimefit:asymmetry_td}
\end{align}
which is a modified version of the theoretical signal asymmetry in
\cref{eq:cpviolation:asymmetry} and accounts for the asymmetries induced by
flavour tagging ($\Delta\omega$) and production asymmetry ($\prodasym{11}$).
The fit results
\begin{align*}
\begin{split}
  \SDD                &= -0.65\,\pm\,0.25 \,, \\
  \CDD                &= \phantom{-}0.24\,\pm\,0.26 \,,
\end{split}
\end{align*}
are compatible with those from the unbinned fit presented in
\cref{eq:b02dd:decaytimefit:cpresults} but not as sensitive.
