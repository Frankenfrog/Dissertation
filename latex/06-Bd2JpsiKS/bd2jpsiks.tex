\label{sec:bd2jpsiks}

The measurement of \CP violation in \BdToJPsiKS
decays~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2015-004} is performed on \lhcb's full Run~I data
sample, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of \SI{3}{\invfb}. The
analysis is based on a collaborative work of Christophe
Cauet~\cite{Cauet-PhDThesis} and myself. Therefore, my main contributions,
namely the decay time resolution study (see
\cref{sec:bd2jpsiks:decaytime:resolution}), the analysis of the backgrounds
(see \cref{sec:bd2jpsiks:backgrounds}), the fitter development, and the
studies of systematic uncertainties (see \cref{sec:bd2jpsiks:systematics}),
are described in more detail, while the other parts are only briefly
summarised to complete the picture. The initial flavour of the \Bd mesons is
determined with the OS combination excluding the OS charm flavour-tagging
algorithm and the cut-based SS\pion tagger. The calibration of these taggers
is described in \cref{sec:dataanalysis:taggingcalibration:jpsixcalibration}.
