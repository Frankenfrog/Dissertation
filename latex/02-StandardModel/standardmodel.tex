\chapter{Standard Model of Particle Physics (5 pages)}
\label{sec:standardmodel}

The Standard Model of particle physics (SM) is a renormalisable
gauge-invariant quantum field theory, which describes the fundamental
constituents of matter (see \cref{sec:standardmodel:particles}) and three of
the four fundamental interactions between them (see
\cref{sec:standardmodel:forces}). It is structured by the conservation
and (spontaneous) breaking of symmetries (see
\cref{sec:standardmodel:symmetries}). Despite being very successful in
explaining experimental data and even predicting their results, there is a
number of issues showing that extensions of the SM are required (see
\cref{sec:standardmodel:extensions}). The following information is mainly
inspired by the description in Ref.~\cite{Brock:2011zz} and based on
explanations given in Refs.~\cite{Griffiths:2008zz,Perkins:1982xb}.
