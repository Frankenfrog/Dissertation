\chapter{The \lhcb Experiment at the \lhc}
\label{sec:detector}

The Large Hadron Collider beauty (\lhcb) experiment is one of the four large
experiments run at CERN, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, in
Geneva, Switzerland. The physics goal of the collaborators at \lhcb is to test
the standard model of particle physics (SM) by performing indirect searches
for new physics with hadrons containing \bquark or \cquark quarks. In contrast
to the direct searches conducted by the multipurpose experiments ATLAS (A
Toroidal LHC Apparatus)~\cite{ATLAS} and CMS (Compact Muon
Solenoid)~\cite{CMS}, \CP-violating processes and rare decay modes are
precisely measured and the results are compared with the predictions of the
SM. This allows to investigate effects caused by heavy unknown particles at
energy scales far beyond what is accessible in direct searches. To do so, it is
mandatory to have a very high vertex, momentum and decay time resolution. The
detector, with which this demanding task is accomplished, is described in
\cref{sec:detector:lhcb}. Beforehand, a description of the accelerator
complex, which provides the proton bunches to collide inside the detector, is
given (see \cref{sec:detector:lhc}). Afterwards, the trigger system (see
\cref{sec:detector:trigger}) and the specific software (see
\cref{sec:detector:software}) are described.
