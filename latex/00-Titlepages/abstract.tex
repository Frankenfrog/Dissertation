\noindent
The \CP violation observables $\Sf$ and $\Cf$ in the decays of \Bd and \Bzb mesons
to the $\jpsi\KS$ final state and to the $\Dp\Dm$ final state are measured with
a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $\SI{3}{\invfb}$
collected with the LHCb experiment in proton-proton collisions at
centre-of-mass energies of \SIlist{7;8}{\TeV}.

The analysis of the time evolution of \num{41500} \BdToJPsiKS decays yields
\begin{align*}
  \SJpsiKS &=  \phantom{-}0.731 \, \pm 0.035 \, \text{(stat)} \pm 0.020 \, \text{(syst)}\,, \\
  \CJpsiKS &=  			- 0.038 \, \pm 0.032 \, \text{(stat)} \pm 0.005 \, \text{(syst)}\,,
\end{align*}
which is consistent with the current world averages and with the
Standard Model expectations.

In a flavour-tagged, decay-time-dependent analysis of \num{1410} \BdToDD
decays the following results are determined:
\begin{align*}
  \SDD &=  -0.54 \, ^{+0.17}_{-0.16} \, \text{(stat)} \pm 0.05 \, \text{(syst)}\,, \\
  \CDD &=  \phantom{-}0.26 \, ^{+0.18}_{-0.17} \, \text{(stat)} \pm 0.02 \, \text{(syst)}\,.
\end{align*}

With these results high-order Standard Model corrections which could lead to
differences between the obtained values of the two decay modes are constrained
to be small.
