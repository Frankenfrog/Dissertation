The fit results of $\SDD$ and $\CDD$ (see \cref{eq:b02dd:decaytimefit:cpresults}) correspond to
\begin{align*}
  \sin(\phid + \Delta \phi) = 0.56\,\pm\,^{0.16}_{0.17}\,,
\end{align*}
where the statistical uncertainty is estimated by generating three million
sets of \SDD and \CDD using a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution including
their correlation, calculating $\sin(\phid + \Delta \phi)$ for each of them, and
then taking the two-side \SI{68}{\percent} confidence intervals.
