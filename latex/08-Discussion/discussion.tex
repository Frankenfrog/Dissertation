\section{Comparison between \texorpdfstring{$\CP$}{CP} violation in
\texorpdfstring{\mbox{$\BdToJPsiKS$}}{Bd2JPsiKS} and in
\texorpdfstring{\mbox{$\BdToDD$}}{Bd2DD} decays}
\label{sec:discussion:JpsiKS_DD_comparison}

Measurements in decays with \bToccbars transitions have established the
presence of \CP violation in the system of neutral $B$ mesons with very high
precision. Comparing the plots of the decay-time-dependent signal yield
asymmetry for \BdToJPsiKS and \BdToDD decays (see
\cref{fig:discussion:asymmetry}), the difference in sensitivity becomes
apparent.

However, the main motivation for the measurement of \CP violation in \BdToDD
decays, presented in this thesis, is not to achieve the single best
measurement of \CP violation. In fact, given the uncertainties the
conservation of \CP symmetry can be excluded by only \num{4.0} standard
deviations with this measurement. Instead, the phase shift $\Delta\phi$ can be
obtained, which is caused by higher-order Standard Model contributions and
complicates the determination of $\beta$ and $\betas$ similarly (see
\cref{sec:cpviolation:btoccbard}). The fit results of $\SDD$ and $\CDD$ (see
\cref{eq:b02dd:decaytimefit:cpresults}) correspond to
\begin{align*}
  \sin(\phid + \Delta \phi) = \frac{-\SDD}{\sqrt{1 - \CDD^2}} = 0.56\,\pm\,^{0.16}_{0.17}\,,
\end{align*}
where the statistical uncertainty is estimated by generating three million
sets of \SDD and \CDD using a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution including
their correlation, calculating $\sin(\phid + \Delta \phi)$ for each of them,
and then taking the two-sided \SI{68}{\percent} confidence intervals. This
result can be combined with the corresponding value from \BdToJPsiKS to
extract the phase shift $\Delta \phi$. The calculation yields $\Delta \phi =
-0.16\,^{+0.19}_{-0.21}$\,\si{\radian}, which is significantly more precise
than the previous measurement using the results by the $B$-factories of
$\Delta \phi = (30\,^{+23}_{-30})\si{\degrees} =
0.52\,^{+0.40}_{-0.56}$~\cite{Bel:2015wha}, and thus represents the world's
most precise determination of this quantity. Moreover, the size of the
higher-order corrections is reduced by more than a factor of three and is
compatible with zero.
