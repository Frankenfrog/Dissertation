\section{Spline interpolation}
\label{sec:dataanalysis:splines}

In many cases phenomenological models are an efficient way of describing
shapes, \eg when parametrising acceptances, which are typically influenced by
more effects than could realistically be analysed separately. Interpolating
cubic splines, which are piecewise defined third order polynomials, are an
useful implementation~\cite{Splines}. They are parametrised by a set of knots
and coefficients at these positions and can be written as the sum over base
splines. The first and second derivatives are continuous throughout the
domain. The choice of the number and positions of the knots determines how
accurate the given shape can be described.

In the \BdToJPsiKS analysis described in this thesis cubic splines are used to
parametrise the shape of the mistag distributions and to transfer a histogram
of the decay-time-dependent efficiency into an unbinned, analytically
integrable representation. In the \BdToDD analysis cubic splines are used to
model the deviation of the decay time distribution from a pure exponential
distribution, which is not caused by \CP-violating effects.
