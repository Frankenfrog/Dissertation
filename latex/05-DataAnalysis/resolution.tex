\section{Decay time resolution}
\label{sec:dataanalysis::resolution}

Uncertainties in the determination of the position of vertices and in the
measurement of momenta (although thanks to the VELO (see
\cref{sec:detector:lhcb}) pretty accurate  at $\lhcb$) lead to a finite decay
time resolution $\sigma$, which dilutes the observed $\CP$ asymmetry by a
factor
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{D} = e^{\frac{-\dmd^2\,\sigma^2}{2}} \, .
\end{align}
This formula is the special case for a Gaussian resolution model with width
$\sigma$. The general formula is derived in
Ref.~\cite{ResolutionDilutionFactor}. For $\Bd$ mesons the dilution induced by
the decay time resolution has only minor influence on the measurement of $\CP$
observables because the oscillation frequency $\dmd$ of $\Bd$ mesons is
rather low. Even for a decay time resolution of \SI{100}{\fs} the dilution
factor is greater than \SI{99}{\percent}.
