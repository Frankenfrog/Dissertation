\section{Decay time resolution}
\label{sec:dataanalysis::resolution}

Uncertainties in the determination of the position of vertices and in the
measurement of momenta (although thanks to the VELO (see
\cref{sec:detector:lhcb}) pretty accurate  at $\lhcb$) lead to a finite decay
time resolution $\sigma$, which dilutes the observed $\CP$ asymmetry by a
factor
%
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{D} = e^{\frac{-\dmd^2\,\sigma^2}{2}} \, .
\end{align}
%
A derivation of this formula can be found in Ref.~\cite{LHCb-ANA-2011-001}.
For $\Bd$ mesons the dilution induced by the decay time resolution has only
minor influence on the measurement of $\CP$ observables because but the
oscillation frequency $\dmd$ of $\Bd$ mesons is rather low. Even for a decay
time resolution of \SI{100}{\fs} the dilution factor is greater than
\SI{99}{\percent}. Nevertheless, an accurate description of the decay time
resolution needs to be found.
