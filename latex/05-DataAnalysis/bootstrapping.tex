\section{Bootstrapping method (0.5 pages)}
\label{sec:dataanalysis:bootstrapping}

An alternative to get proper uncertainty estimates is the bootstrap method. In
this frequentist model-independent approach a new data sample is generated by
drawing events from the nominal data sample until the number of candidates
matches the statistics in the original one (the same event can be drawn
multiple times).
