\section{Blinding}
\label{sec:dataanalysis:blinding}

To eliminate the experimenter's bias, a blinding transformation is applied on
the fitted \CP parameters \SDD and \CDD with the
\verb|RooUnblindUniform| method of \roofit's \verb|RooBlindTools|~\cite{roofit}.
The transformation implemented in the \verb|RooUnblindUniform| method adds a
hidden offset to the fit parameter. Doing so, the uncertainty on the extracted
parameter does not change and can still be used for understanding the outcome of
the fit. The hidden offset is drawn from a uniform distribution with a range
$\pm s$, using a random number generator with known seed. The seed is generated
from a so-called \emph{blinding string}. If two different analyses of the same
physics parameter agree on a common scale and blinding string, then the results
of those analyses can be compared without unblinding. We choose the range of the
uniform distribution to be $[-2,2]$. Given the physical range of \sintwobeta is
$[-1,1]$, this ensures a good opacity.
