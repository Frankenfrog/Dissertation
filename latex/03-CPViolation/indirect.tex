\subsection{Indirect \texorpdfstring{$\CP$}{CP} violation}
\label{sec:cpviolation:types:indirect}

Indirect \CP violation occurs when the mass eigenstates are no \CP eigenstates
and instead a relative phase is present between $M_{12}$ and $\Gamma_{12}$.
Following \cref{eq:cpviolation:neutralBmesons:qp} this means
\begin{align}
	\left|\frac qp \right| \neq 1\,.
\end{align}
So, it can be interpreted as difference of the mixing probabilities between
\Bd and \Bdb mesons
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{P}(\Bd\!\to\Bdb,t) \neq \mathcal{P}(\Bdb\!\to\Bd,t)\,,
\end{align}
and thus is also called \CP violation in mixing. While this type of \CP
violation has been observed in the system of neutral kaons, all measurements
in the system of neutral $B$ mesons yield values for the asymmetry of
semileptonic decays
\begin{align}
	a_{\mathrm{sl}} = \frac{\Gamma(\Bdb(t)\!\to\ellp\nu X) - \Gamma(\Bd(t)\!\to\ellm\nu X)}{\Gamma(\Bdb(t)\!\to\ellp\nu X) + \Gamma(\Bd(t)\!\to\ellm\nu X)} = \frac{1 - |q/p|^4}{1 + |q/p|^4}
\end{align}
consistent with zero~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2014-053,LHCb-PAPER-2016-013}, though
the precision is one to two magnitudes above the SM expectations. This lack in
precision is not only due to statistical uncertainties. When extracting the
\CP asymmetry from the raw asymmetry further asymmetries, like detection and
production asymmetries, need to be taken into account, and these are not
precisely known.
