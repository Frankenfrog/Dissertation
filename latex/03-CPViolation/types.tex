\section{Types of \texorpdfstring{$\CP$}{CP} violation}
\label{sec:cpviolation:types}

There are three different manifestations of \CP violation. It can occur, when
the decay amplitudes differ between \CP conjugated processes (see
\cref{sec:cpviolation:types:direct}), when the mass eigenstates are no \CP
eigenstates (see \cref{sec:cpviolation:types:indirect}), and when there is
interference between direct decays and decays to the same final state after
mixing (see \cref{sec:cpviolation:types:interference}). While the first type
can appear for charged and neutral hadrons, the latter are only possible for
neutral decays.

All types of \CP violation can be summarized with the condition $\lambda_f
\neq 1$.
